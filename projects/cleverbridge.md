I started as a Frontend Developer using C# and IIS. After a while i drove a Microservice Initiative with some of my colleagues. I was Part of the Team that introduced node.js and angular.js. We showed that we can refactor and scale parts of the business logic without rewriting the whole Monolothic Application.
